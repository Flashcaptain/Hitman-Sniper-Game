README v0.50 - 09.18.15

AL Female Civilians Pack is a pack of contemporary female civilians clothes designed for use in Unity Multipurpose Avatar system. 

It is a free pack - but - in return, we would like to ask you for a support of our game, Galactic Insomnia. 

Right now we it means support of our Kickstarter campaign @https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1016311142/galactic-insomnia/posts/1336261 (could be bit too late though)
or Steam Greenlight campaign @http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/stats/506930024

IMPORTANT NOTES:
This pack is compatible with UMA 2.0 / Unity 4.6.6f2 and is a last version supporting Unity 4.x.
While importing to Unity 5.2.0f3 works flawlessly , there is some issue in the test scene with DNA Editor Panel (probably some mismatch between Unity 5 i Unity 4 UMA versions)
